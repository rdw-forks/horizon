## Why Horizon?
### 1. Customizability and Extended Functionality

Built with the need for more customizability in mind, Horizon offers a comprehensive solution for the extended functionality of RO features such as the following, through the use of Lua (our scripting language) :

- Skills
- Status Effects
- Combat and damage components
- In-game **At-commands**
- Development oriented **Script-commands** 
- Server Administration based **Console-commands**
- Game Administration based **Web-commands**

### 2. High Performance and Maintainability

The project leverages advanced C++ features and OOP design principles and follows best coding practices to ensure high performance and maintainability. Each feature in the project is carefully designed with software design principles such as -

- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)

### 3. Features

It includes a variety of features such as a -

- Multithreaded infrastructure
- Packet-based networking system
- Database Support
- Lua scripting engine
- Console interface

making it a go-to choice for server owners that want a modern industry-standard solution for their RO server. It is aimed to be a high-end solution for RO server owners catering to larger user populations, allowing a seamless and uninterrupted support of thousands of players at once.

### 4. Flexibility

Whether you're looking to build a small server that offers a variety of customizations, or a large one, HorizonXYZ/Horizon provides the tools and flexibility you need to achieve your goals.

### 5. Open Source

The project is open-source and encourages contributions from developers who are interested in enhancing its capabilities and reach.
