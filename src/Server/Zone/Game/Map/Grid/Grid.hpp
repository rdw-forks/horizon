//! @details Grid is used to store objects in a 2D grid. This is used to speed up the search for objects in a given area.
//! The grid is divided into cells of a given size. Each grid-cell contains a list of objects that are in that grid-cell.
//! The grid is actually stored in the GridHolder class.
//!	- The GridHolder class is a container for Grids.
//! - The Grid class is a container for objects.
//! - The GridReferenceContainer class is a container for objects in a grid-cell.
//! - The GridReferenceContainerVisitor class is used to visit the objects in a grid-cell.
//! @tparam ACTIVE_OBJECT is the object that is stored in the grid.
//! @tparam GRID_OBJECT_TYPES is a type-list of object types that are stored in the grid.
//! @param _container is the container for objects in the grid-cell.
